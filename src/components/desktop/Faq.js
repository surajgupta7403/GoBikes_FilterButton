                Yes. You can cancel your booking by going to the Bookings
                sections in the Profile tab. Upon booking a bike with any of our

                cancellation, unnecessary inconvenience is caused to the dealer.

                amount as cancellation charges as follows: No Show - 100%
                deduction. Between 0-24 hrs of the pickup time - 100% deduction.
                Between 24-72 hrs of the pickup time - 50% rental charges will
                be withheld. Before 72 hrs of the pickup time - Full Refund to
                the customer
